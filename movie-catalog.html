Celebrities were often startled, flattered, or dismayed by the questions he would ask about less frequently discussed or even obscure aspects of their lives and careers. His questioning was probing and revealing, but never adversarial. His most famous interview was one done with Burt Reynolds, where Reynolds exclaimed, “You just hit nerves.” Apparently, for some time, Linehan’s unprecedented interview approach made this show a popular fad among celebrities in Hollywood.</p>

<p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong> The main character in this story is Francisco Romero (excellently played by Jorge Poza), a small-town teacher who decides to try his luck in Mexico City. He joins the faculty of Prep school number 10 “Rosario Castellanos” and soon realizes that his work is more demanding than he expected; in addition to having to prove himself as a teacher, he must prove himself as a human being. He will find that, in order to make a difference with his students, he will also have to assume the roles of counselor, psychologist, doctor, and even detective. The themes this story deals with are: dropping out of school, teen pregnancy, street gangs, men who abuse their stepdaughters, teenagers forced to work to support their families, and alcoholic parents who lead their children down the same path - that is, problems of a very real nature, experienced by high school students the world over. This is also a love story. Both students and faculty fall victim to Cupid’s random arrows, beginning with Francisco and Adriana (the school counselor) who, nonetheless, must put their hormones on hold long enough to become respected role models in the eyes of their students. But their love story is not destined for a happy ending, since Adriana will have to choose between Francisco and her love for her son. Fortunately, Francisco will have a second chance at love with Ana Maria (Alexa Damian), the new English teacher who will become his right arm when dealing with his students and their problems in and out of school. Ultimately, however, he will find true love in the arms of Angela (Alejandra Barros), the woman in charge of the school cafeteria. She is a working mother whose teenage children Juan David (Alfonso Herrera) and Sandra (Karla Cossio) attend this same school, and who has managed to keep a fine balance between being a housewife, a working woman, a mother and a lover. The school itself occupies center stage in this story, and will become the forum where the main conflicts of the plot will be exposed and resolved, and where Francisco Romero, in his role as teacher, will not only show his students how entertaining learning can be, but will make them understand the importance of respect for authority, of friendship, camaraderie, love, and the values that will guide their conduct as they close the cycle of adolescence and move on to become adults. One of the recurring themes in this telenovela is friendship, which is best exemplified by the story of Gabriela (Sherlyn) and Marcela (Dulce Maria), two high school students who struggle to get ahead and maintain their friendship alive in spite of the painful experiences they go through and the many obstacles that threaten to drive them apart. Their friendship will be put to the test when one of them realizes that everyone will give you advice, but no one will stand with you to face the consequences. Alcohol abuse among teenagers, sexual responsibility, domestic violence and prostitution are also topics addressed in this production. More problems are Magdalena (Iran Castillo), a strikingly beautiful young woman with a rebellious nature. She faces domestic abuse, while another student Hugo (Pablo Magallanes), gets involved with gangs leading to his death. Carlos (Francisco Rubio) get swindled into drug dealing, while Tatiana (Sara Maldonado) comes as the teen who feels out of place as a rich kid whose family has gone poor and must adapt to face the gang 406. She ultimately leads to drugs much later on. More students are Kike (Aaron Diaz) who becomes an alcoholic, Alfredo (Frantz Cossio) who deals with being gay, and Daniela (Grettell Valdez) whose dreams of becoming a model almost lead her to the end of her life. The toughest struggle is when Francisco, their professor who has stuck through thick and thin with them must leave with his new wife. A new professor Santiago (Francisco Gattorno) takes his place. Can the students accept him? Will he be able to fill the void that was left by his predocessor? His troubled past including a young girl who was sexually harassing him in an old school he taught and when he does not agree to have a relationship with her she accuses him of rape. The girl with the troubled mind is known as Jessica (Anahi). Her story is one of the classics, a poor rich girl who wishes to act like a villian due to a father who doesnt pay attention to her, and a dead mother who she strives for. Clase 406 shows the hardships of being a teen with modern day problems that have been ignored because they have been too taboo. In the clase 406, nothing is taboo and anything can happen…</p>

<p><strong>Running time:</strong> 30</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 1987</p>
<p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong> Revival of the classic NBC game show where two contestants, one a returning champion, faced a computer-generated board of 25 squares. Game play was the same as before: Each contestant called out a pair of numbers on the board, which contained the names of prizes and WILD and TAKE cards (the latter two explained later). No match passed control to the opponent, but a match gave whatever prize was named or a TAKE marker, revealed two pieces of the rebus (identifying a person, phrase, place, thing, etc.) and allowed him/her a chance to solve the rebus. WILD cards provided an automatic match; revealing two WILD cards in the same turn earned a $500 bonus, while uncovering the third take meant a $1,000 bonus and the opportunity to reveal up to five pieces of the rebus at once. Contestants uncovering a TAKE card (red and green cards, with a color match required) could, upon a correct match, elect to hold onto the marker to wait for their opponent to collect a better prize or to take back a desired prize their opponent had already taken. Only upon correctly solving the rebus does a player actually win what he/she claimed from the board; the loser forfeits all his gifts. The winner played a bonus game that used a 15-square board, with a car used as a grand prize. The model names of eight cars (e.g., FIREBIRD, JUSTY, 323, etc.) appeared on the board, with one of them not having a match. Contestants successfully matching the seven car names within 35 seconds won the last car named and retired the player undefeated; otherwise, an extra 5 seconds was added to the clock each for each subsequent trip to the bonus game (later in the show’s run, uncovering a “FIVE BONUS SECONDS” card and winning the game added 5 more seconds to the clock). The rules affecting a champion’s reign, aside from winning a car and leaving undefeated, changed throughout the run at first, it was one loss and done (early on, contestants could also win more than one car); later, players cold lose twice before their defeat; still later, a best-of-three format was used, while the rules reverted back to the second format even later. An annual tournament of champions (with participants determined by cash winnings) offered a trip-around-the-world as a grand prize during the first year; during the second through fourth years, a luxury car was the top prize. Production of “Classic Concentration” ceased during the summer of 1991; the network aired reruns through January 1994.</p>

<p><strong>Running time:</strong> 30</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> 1997</p>
<p><strong>Plot Summary:</strong> Three teams of two members competed in this interactive website race game. In Round 1, each of the 3 teams were given 60 seconds (independently) to earn as much money as they possibly could by using a computer and mouse to randomly select the category with their dollar value (which was either $25 or $50 in Round 1), and then racing to the appropriate places while answering each question. Several questions asked you to go to either the “Web Site,” where you could receive e-mails (by naming who wrote this e-mail letter), Click Pix (questions regarding a photo) or Sound Bytes (Q’s with audio). There was also the “Word Wizard,” whose questions ranged from Spellcheck (identify the misspelled word in each of the phrases), Dictionary (e.g., What is the right spelling of the word)?, or Thesaurus (e.g., What word has a certain definition)? Also, there was “Double Click,” in which one question could double the team’s score. They kept at it until time runs out. In Round 2, a team stood at their podium until their partner comes up with the wrong answer or they click on the “Virus,” which in their situation, host Seacrest asked a question to the opposing two teams, the team who buzzed in with the right answer got control of the mouse or the team at the computer remained there. Dollar values were $50-$75. In the third and final round, Host Seacrest would be in control of the mouse, while each team is separated. One player from each team went to either the Motherboard, Web Site or Word Wizard while the other teammate stayed at their podiums. Each correct answer on a question was worth $100. After the teammates switched from their podiums to the stations, 3x, etc., whoever has the most money wins the game. In the bonus round, the team had to answer 3 questions correctly to win 2 laptop computers. Very often, the team clicked a question, and went to the proper area, thus the teammate would answer the question. The teammate has 45 seconds to get all 3 questions right before winning the computers. During its two-season run, there was no Motherboard; players had to run to the “Hard Drive” for general knowledge questions, but the Word Wizard and Web Site remained (although the Web Site had never been mentioned). The other change in the first round was that only one player remained at the mouse while his/her partner did all the racing. If the racer gets the question wrong or passes, then the clicker could answer it. Limited changed were made in the second round and everything was completed that the “Virus” was renamed the “Crash”. In the third round, in order to promote appropriate behavior, Host Seacrest turned his back to the screen when he clicked. Also in the second season, the bonus round was tweaked so that each correct answer would win the team $100 in 60 seconds (instead of 45), and all 3 correct answers won that team the jackpot and those computers.</p>
